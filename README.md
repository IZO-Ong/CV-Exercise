# VisionFit

VisionFit is a hackathon projectâ€”a computer vision-powered fitness tracking app built with Streamlit. It uses OpenCV for computer vision, YOLO for exercise tracking, LangChain for LLM RAG, and SQLite3 for data storage. The app helps users track push-ups and sit-ups while providing insights, historical data, and chatbot interaction.

## Features

### 1. **Main Page**
   - View your exercise stats and progress.
   - Graph visualization of your workouts.
   - AI-powered recommender bot provides feedback on your performance.
